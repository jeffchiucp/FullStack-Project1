This is project one as the part of full stack web developer nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004).
I will write **server-side code** to store a list of my favorite movies, including:
* box art imagery
* movie trailer URL
I will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.


# Why this Project?

At their core, Full Stack Web Developers are programmers - we just happen to specialize in writing applications for the web! In this project, weâ€™ll write your first application that is accessible via a web browser.

# What will I Learn?

I will learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python. You will then learn how to make this application serve HTML via a web server.

# How does this Help my Career?

* I will establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python
* I  will understand the role a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response

# Steps to complete this project?

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
How will students complete this project?

Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py) - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
*Final uploading time : July-August 2015*
